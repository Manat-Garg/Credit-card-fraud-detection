Credit Card Fraud Detection
üîç Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial application of machine learning in the financial sector to prevent unauthorized and fraudulent transactions. Due to the rarity of fraud cases compared to legitimate ones, this is a highly imbalanced classification problem where detecting fraudulent transactions (the minority class) is critical.

üéØ Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, which poses additional challenges for the model's performance.

üì¶ Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Records: 284,807 transactions

Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.172%)

Features:

28 anonymized features (V1, V2, ..., V28)

Time: Time elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction.

Amount: Transaction amount.

Class: Target variable (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)

‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing/null values.

Feature scaling (Amount and Time normalized using StandardScaler).

Addressing class imbalance using:

Undersampling (reducing the majority class).

Oversampling (using SMOTE).

2. Model Selection:
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

These models are evaluated based on their ability to detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

3. Evaluation Metrics:
Due to imbalanced classes, we do not rely solely on accuracy. Instead, we consider:

Precision: How many predicted frauds are actual frauds?

Recall (Sensitivity): How many actual frauds were detected?

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

ROC-AUC: Ability to distinguish between classes.

üìä Key Challenges
Severe Class Imbalance: Less than 0.2% of transactions are fraudulent.

Risk of False Negatives: Missing a fraudulent transaction can lead to financial loss.

Model Generalization: Avoid overfitting while maintaining high recall on minority class.

üèÜ Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent transactions, even in highly imbalanced datasets. Techniques such as SMOTE, proper evaluation metrics (like F1-Score and AUC-ROC), and ensemble models (Random Forest/XGBoost) significantly improve fraud detection performance.

üöÄ Future Scope
Deploy the model as a real-time API for transaction screening.

Use advanced anomaly detection methods (e.g., Autoencoders, Isolation Forest).

Incorporate temporal and sequence-based data for improved detection
