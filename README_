💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
Credit card fraud is a major issue in financial transactions worldwide. Detecting fraudulent activities before they cause significant financial damage is critical. This project applies various machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions based on transaction patterns.

🎯 Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately classify whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0) using a given dataset. Since fraud cases are very rare compared to legitimate ones, this is an imbalanced classification problem that requires special techniques to handle class disparity.

📦 Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Total Records: 284,807

Fraudulent Cases: 492 (0.172%)

Features:

Time: Seconds elapsed since the first transaction.

Amount: Transaction amount.

V1 to V28: Principal Components derived by PCA (due to confidentiality).

Class: 0 for legitimate, 1 for fraud.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

🔧 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Checked for missing values (none found).

Feature scaling (Time and Amount) using StandardScaler.

Handled class imbalance with:

Random Under Sampling (RUS)

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

2. Model Training & Evaluation
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluation Metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Score

3. Results Summary (Sample)
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	99.27%	84%	82%	83%	98.1%
Random Forest Classifier	99.85%	92%	86%	89%	99.2%
XGBoost Classifier	99.91%	94%	90%	92%	99.5%

🚨 Note: Precision and Recall are more important here than overall Accuracy due to class imbalance.

📊 Key Challenges
Highly Imbalanced Dataset: Less than 0.2% transactions are fraudulent.

False Negatives Risk: Misclassification can result in real financial fraud going unnoticed.

Model Overfitting: Especially when using oversampling techniques.

🏆 Conclusion
Models like Random Forest and XGBoost provide high precision and recall scores suitable for detecting rare fraud transactions.

SMOTE effectively handles class imbalance, improving model performance.

Careful metric selection (like ROC-AUC and F1-Score) is critical over just Accuracy.

🚀 Future Scope
Deploy model as a Flask or FastAPI API.

Integrate with real-time transaction systems.

Explore deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders) for time-series fraud detection.

Implement cost-sensitive learning to minimize financial risk.
